                                    <p>Chelsea tractors, off roaders, 4x4s, 4WDs. Whatever you call them they’re one of the most versatile and reliable types of vehicle you can buy, no matter the time of year.

                                        So what is it about these vehicles that makes them so popular? Plus which is the best option for you, New or Old? <br> <br>
                                        
                                        Better and more reliable traction <br>
                                        4×4 means ‘4 wheel drive’, this means you get power to all 4 wheels.
                                        
                                        Depending on the manufacturer and model, you might be able to switch between 2 and 4-wheel drive, you might get permanent 4 wheel drive, or you might get an ‘on demand’ system that switches automatically between 2- and 4-wheel drive depending on road conditions.
                                        This 'on demand' system is usually seen in the more modern 4x4 opposed to the earlier models. <br> <br>
                                          
                                        Comfort and Space <br>
                                        Your older 4x4 vehicles tend to be orientated around function rather than comfort. Thats not to say simple modifications cannot be done to dramatically improve the driving positioin and comfort on long journeys.
                                        Newer vehicles will usually come with heated leather, air conditioning and carpeted interiors as standard. If you plan on racking up the miles, this may be something you need to consider before making a purchase. <br> <br>
                                        
                                        Modifications <br>
                                        Most off road vehicles will have plenty of after-marker parts available. You will find it is easier to aquire parts and there is more availability for the older models. This is usually because they have been round 
                                        for long enough that there are now second hand parts available. Plus companies have had more time to put after-marker parts together. <br>
                                        Some say that modern 4x4's need less modifications as they usually come with all the bells and whistles from the factory. <br> <br>
                                        
                                        Price <br>
                                        You will be sure to find a 4x4 to suite most budgets. If you are looking for something new, with a budget on the lower side, you may want to consider the smaller compact 4x4's, like the Suzuki Jimmny. 
                                        Many of the big brand off-road manufactures usually start prices from £20,000+. This can be offputting to people who are looking to take their cars off the beaten track, where bumps, scrapes and scratches are likely to happen. 
                                        You can take precautions and add extra's onto your new card to protect it, this will likely bump the price up and isnt fool proof. <br>
                                        Price is one of the main reasons most people opt for an older model 4x4. They are usually a bit rougher round the edges and because of that, cost significantly less. A good, reliable used 4x4 can cost as little as £2000.
                                        When you compare that to a new price, its no wonder most people opt for an older vehicle.

                                        Tyres keep us moving, have a read through my reviews and ratings from a range of budget remoulds to the bestselling brands. 
                                        We put together a series of roubust tests to see which performed best.
                                    </p> <br>
                                    <h4>Maxxis Creepy Crawler M8090</h4>
                                    <p>This tyre is designed to offer the longevity of an off-road tyre with unparalleled grip for rock climbing.

                                        They have Super-soft, extra sticky compound for rock climbing!
                                        Heavy-duty construction for long-lasting off-road performance.
                                        Incredible bite into mud and snow.
                                        Agile steering response for ultimate control which makes them perfect for competition rock crawling.
                                        These are a specialist tyre and we would not recommend for the lighter green lanes. 
                                    </p> <br>
                                    <h4>Cooper Discoverer STT PRO</h4>
                                    <p>The Cooper Discoverer STT PRO is the most aggressive 4x4 tyre Cooper offers to date. The STT PRO boasts Armor Tek3 Construction for added durability. 
                                        The tyre offers remarkable off-road performance and in John Craddocks opinion is still an excellent on-road tyre for a mud terrain pattern.
                                        We found these to be a great all-rounder trye and also great value for money.
                                    </p> <br>
                                    <h4>BFGoodrich KM3 Mud Terrain</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Building upon decades of off-road racing dominance, BFGoodrich has adapted the race-proven technology of the Baja 1000-winning Mud-Terrain
                                         T/A® KM3 and Baja T/A® KR2 to create our newest UTV offering.
                                         Power through mud and loose soil with our Terrain-Attack tread design. Its massive tread blocks are designed to deliver incredible grip from any angle of approach, 
                                         and Mud-Phobic Bars release compacted mud for continued traction.
